# Installation
lsmsd requires Go 1.4 or greater. Thanks to the Go toolset the installation is very easy. Just type the following in your terminal and press Enter:

    go get github.com/openlab-aux/lsmsd

This software needs a running instance of mongoDB. For install instructions [click here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

# Building a test instance with Vagrant

Spin up the box with `vagrant up`. `vagrant ssh` into the box and start lsmsd:

    cd /vagrant
    cp example_config.gcfg config.gcfg
    ./lsmsd

Leave the terminal open. Now you should be able to access the lsmsd api on your host machine on port 8080
